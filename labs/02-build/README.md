# Lab 2 - CodeBuild

## Creating and running a CodeBuild project

In this lab we will create a simple CodeBuild project along with the crucial BuildSpec file which will be used when running builds within the CodeBuild project. 

What we will learn:
* How setup and configure a CodeBuild project
* How CodeBuild fits in with a CodePipeline
* How CodeBuild handles the input source
* Running a build vs CodePipeline triggered builds
* Troubleshooting a build/viewing logs and phase details
